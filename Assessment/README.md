# Pulsar Prediction README

This README guide is for linux and Mac machines which have a shell/bash-like terminal. Users need to have 'virtualenv' installed on their machine.

This project uses a virtual environment for deployment. This keeps the host environment clean by not installing potentially conflicting packages. To install the virtual environment, call 'sh installation.sh', which will create a virtualenv called 'pulsar_classification_env'.

Once installed, you can deploy the project by calling 'source run.sh'
